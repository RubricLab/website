				<h1>The Lab</h1>
				<p>
					Our vision for the lab is to engineer the earliest stage in a
					product&apos;s lifecycle â€” the path to Product Market Fit (PMF).
				</p>
				<p>
					Recent AI capabilities have made it apparent that the barrier to building
					software is going to zero.
				</p>
				<p>Software will be abundant.</p>
				<p>
					So who will win in an abundant world? Engineers with a growth mindset.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our vision for the lab is to systemize the path to finding PMF, one
					experiment at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					We&apos;re learning in public. We will make mistakes, but one thing is for
					certain, we will share all our findings in our{' '}
