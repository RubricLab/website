## Capability

Open-source LLMs are thriving. Since the summer of 2023, OS LLMs have rapidly approached human-level performance across a suite of benchmarks.

For now, GPT-4 remains the best. What's more, GPT-5 will come out around September 2024, according to prediction markets. We can expect the envelope to be pushed further by any jump in capabilities.
