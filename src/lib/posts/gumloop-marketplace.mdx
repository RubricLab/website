## Background

- Client: [Gumloop](https://gumloop.com)
- Industry: AI Automation
- Size: 10-50 employees

Gumloop is a fast-growing YC-backed AI automation platform ($20M+ raised) that enables non-technical users to build sophisticated workflows through a visual, no-code interface.
With customers ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to individual creators, Gumloop needed to evolve their internal template directory into a thriving creator marketplace.

## Getting from A to B

Gumloop's community had cultivated thousands of prolific creators building innovative automation templates, but their work remained behind closed doors.
With demand growing for diverse, creator-made solutions, it was time to open the platform. Gumloop’s co-founders Max and Rahul envisioned a public marketplace where creators could showcase their automations to both existing users and new audiences discovering Gumloop through search, with the future potential for creators to build meaningful traffic from their expertise.

So we flew to their San Francisco office for a week of intense collaboration.

Working in-person with the product team, we were able to gather sufficient context to sprint on this vision, which included:
- A seamless way for creators to publish and share their workflows and agents
- Discoverable, SEO-optimized pages that drive organic traffic
- An experience that reduces publishing friction while maintaining quality
- Scalable infrastructure to support a growing creator economy

## Building to Launch

Working closely with Gumloop’s design and engineering teams gave tailwinds to the project, allowing us to build the public-facing Gumloop Marketplace over the course of just one month.
We extended the existing template infrastructure with:
- Creator publishing workflows with AI auto-generation of template descriptions
- Pixel-perfect, SEO-optimized [template pages](https://gumloop.com/marketplace/gmail-summarizer) built for conversion and discoverability
- Scalable architecture supporting workflows, flows, and even [agents](https://gumloop.com/agents)
- Back-compatibility with pre-built and internally-published templates
- Seamless integration with Gumloop's existing platform and authentication systems

## Partnering for Long-Term Growth

Rubric Labs first partnered with Gumloop two years ago, building the v1 of their UI system and landing page during the company's early days.
Returning to support the Marketplace launch reflects our commitment to being long-term partners who bet on our clients' growth. 
We're excited to continue building alongside Gumloop as they scale.


[Gumloop Marketplace](https://gumloop.com/marketplace) transforms Gumloop's template ecosystem from an internal catalog into a growth engine, enabling community-driven content creation, improving organic visibility, and laying the foundation for a creator economy within the platform.
