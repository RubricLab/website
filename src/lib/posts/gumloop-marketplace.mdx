## Client Background

- Client Name: Gumloop
- Industry: AI Automation
- Company Size: 10-50 employees
- Brief Description: Gumloop is a no-code platform to build and host AI-powered business automations.
- Previous Solution: In-app directory of Gumloop-built automation templates

## Summary

[Gumloop](https://gumloop.com) is a fast-growing YC-backed AI automation platform ($20M+ raised) that enables non-technical users to build sophisticated workflows through a visual, no-code interface.
With customers ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to individual creators, Gumloop needed to evolve their internal template directory into a thriving creator marketplace.

## The Challenge

Gumloop's community had cultivated thousands of prolific creators building innovative automation templates, but their work remained behind closed doors.
With demand growing for diverse, creator-made solutions, it was time to open the platform. Gumloop’s co-founders Max and Rahul envisioned a public marketplace where creators could showcase their automations to both existing users and new audiences discovering Gumloop through search, with the future potential for creators to build meaningful traffic from their expertise.
To realize this vision, they needed:
- A seamless way for creators to publish and share their workflows and agents
- Discoverable, SEO-optimized pages that drive organic traffic
- An experience that reduces publishing friction while maintaining quality
- Scalable infrastructure to support a growing creator economy

## Results and Benefits

Rubric Labs worked with Gumloop’s design and engineering teams to build the public-facing Gumloop Marketplace over the course of just one month, extending the existing template infrastructure with:
- Creator publishing workflows with AI auto-generation of template descriptions
- Pixel-perfect, SEO-optimized template pages built for conversion and discoverability
- Scalable architecture supporting workflows, flows, and even agents
- Back-compatibility with pre-built and internally-published templates
- Seamless integration with Gumloop's existing platform and authentication systems
