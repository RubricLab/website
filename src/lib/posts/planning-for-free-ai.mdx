## Capability

Open-source LLMs are thriving. Since the summer of 2023, OS LLMs have rapidly approached human-level performance across a suite of benchmarks.

For now, GPT-4 remains the best. What's more, GPT-5 will come out around September 2024, according to prediction markets. We can expect the envelope to be pushed further by any jump in capabilities.

Regardless, open-source (or at least [open-access](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2)) LLMs continue to catch up.

## Cost

Self-hosting LLMs can help to protect customer data, prevent [fluctuations in ability](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gpt-4-is-getting-significantly-dumber-over-time-according-to-a-study/), and build more defensible tech. Surely, this option is complicated and costly? Quite the opposite. The price for GPT-3-level models is in freefall.

## Timeline

What would you build if GPT-4 were 10x cheaper? What about 100x cheaper? 100x faster?

This is not an outlandish vision but a near-inevitable trend. As we hurdle toward a future where human-level intelligence is virtually free and abundant, how can we prepare?

What if every student had a genius-level tutor, every SMB had Fortune 500-level marketing resources, and every online community had Stripe-level engineering? How do we ensure that these trends serve to close digital gaps rather than widen them?

## Opportunity

Our future is not written in stone; it's coded in bytes and shaped by every line of code we write, every application we dream up, and every conversation we have about what comes next.
